This repo contains artifacts for our CNERT'23 Demo paper. In particular, we provide the  
* the wireless (WiFi and Cellular) network link traces that were collected in the same time and place (see Traces folder)
* scripts to run the reference experiment that emulates a multipath wireless scenario by "playing back" the wireless link traces in both CloudLab and FABRIC testbeds.
