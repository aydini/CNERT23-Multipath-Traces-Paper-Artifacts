This repo contains artifacts for our demo paper in [CNERT 2023 Workshop](https://infocom2023.ieee-infocom.org/10th-international-workshop-computer-and-networking-experimental-research-using-testbeds-cnert-call). In particular, we provide the  
* the wireless (WiFi and Cellular) netw0ork link traces that were collected in the same time and place (see [Traces](Traces) folder)
* scripts to run the reference experiment that emulates a multipath wireless scenario by "playing back" the wireless link traces in both CloudLab and FABRIC testbeds.
