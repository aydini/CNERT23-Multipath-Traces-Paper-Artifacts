This repo contains artifacts for reproducing our experiment on emulating multipath wireless scenarios on a networking testbed. In particular, we provide the  
* the wireless (WiFi and Cellular) network link traces that were collected in the same time and place (see [Traces](Traces) folder)
* instructions and scripts to run the reference experiment that emulates a multipath wireless scenario by "playing back" the link traces in both CloudLab and FABRIC testbeds. (see [the witestlab blog](https://witestlab.poly.edu/blog/emulating-multipath-wireless/))
